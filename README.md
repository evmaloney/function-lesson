## What is a function?
Functions are one of the essential building blocks of a program. They can be thought of as the verbs, or the "action" pieces of the code. Functions are designed to perform a specific task, or set of tasks, each time we run them. It is not always as explicit as this, but generally speaking, each time you click on a button on the screen, assuming it is a working button that actually performs a duty, it fires of a function. This function can potentially fire off other functions, and other functions, each with their own specific task that they are designed to perform. Now you might see a little more clearly why functions are considered a building block of programming.
Often times, a function can take in information (input), do its "task" (or "tasks") with that info, and send out an altered or new piece of information (output) to be used elsewhere.

(Algebra anyone?)
